A)

1.

UnitCode is not null.

UnitCode represents a valid, existing unit code.

The receiver object for removeUnit() is not null.

A valid database and database connection exist.

2.”unitCode” does not exist in the database and no record appears in the enrolment table.

3. Recall that invariants are assertions that should hold true before and after every method call of a class.

4. removeRecord() removes access from the unit table and does not modify other table.

B)	

1. Test Suites – 

Using for easily organizing and running tests.

In Junit, when group multiple test cases into test suite, these test cases can be run together.

     Test Runners – 

Both graphical and textual.

Run the tests – main().

Test Runners will run only methods annotated as @Test, irrespectively how the methods are named.

Uses the result to report to the user or update this display.

2. If the Area of the square = a * a

	package myJavaPackage;

	public class TestClassJunit{

		public int square (int x) {

			return a*a;

		}

	}









3.  package myJavaPackage;

     import static org.junit.Assert.*;

     import org.junit.Test;

     public class JunitTestCase{

                 @Test

                  Public void test(){

                            TestClassJunit test = new

                            TestClassJunit():

                            Int output = test.square(8);

                            assertEquals(64.output);

                      }

           }



C)

Public class indexOf {

    Public static void main (String [] args) {

    String str = “Welcome to Softwaretestinghelp”;

    System.out.println (str.indexOf (“to”));

               }

}
